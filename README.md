# PixelArtWatchOS

This project, started at YHack 2019, is a watchOS app where you can create pixel art right on your wrist!

I decided on this project because I just got an Apple Watch and wanted to see if I can develop an app for it and learn about Swift/Swift UI

# Goals
- Learn the basics of how to develop for Apple devices with Xcode
- Learn Swift basics
- Implement using the newly released Swift UI
- Deploy and test on my own device

# Functionality
- Select color from presets in color bar
- Selected color is slightly smaller, so that you know what color you are currently using
- Digital Crown can be used to scroll through colors in color bar
- Eraser

# To Do
- Change grid size (Possibly with Digital Crown)
- Drag to draw/erase
- Custom colors with RGB selector
- Speed up scrolling/refresh from Digital Crown
- Export image to camera roll (Directly make watch face?)
- Clear board/erase all
- Add other features!
